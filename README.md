# CareerFairOpenSlots
A tool to generate a json file containing only the companies and positions that have available meeting times on Career Fair Plus.


### Usage
Edit `main.py` and update the `fair_list` dictionary with the URLs, and optionally, a major to filter the list by. Be warned some fairs do not have the major filter option.
